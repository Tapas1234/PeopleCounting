PEOPLE COUNTING

This project proposes a low-cost method for counting people based on object detection and object tracking.
Here background subtraction is used to detected object and then the object is classified with its width and height to specify that the object is a person.
In this system we first define the area of entry and exit point in the video frame. The counting of people starts when midpoint of the people crosses the defined point.
Finally, total number of people entry and exit from the place is displayed.
